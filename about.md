I am Qianqian Tang, a researcher in biology-related areas. My research interests span two areas. One is studying how animals and their surrounding environments interact with each other. The other is applying computing and statistical technologies into analysis of biological datasets which tend to be bulky and noisy.  
<!--<span class = "note">Right now, I am applying for a PhD degree in biology or bioinformatics</span>-->
